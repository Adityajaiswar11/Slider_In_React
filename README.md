# React + Vite
This code is a simple image slider component written in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.The code starts by importing the required dependencies, including the useState hook from React, and several icons from the react-icons library.

2.Next, the code defines an array of image source URLs (imageList) and a state variable count to keep track of the current image index.

3.The handleClickPlus function increments the count state variable by 1, while the handleClickMinus function decrements it by 1. Both functions ensure that the count variable stays within the bounds of the imageList array length.

4.The main component is defined as ImagesSlider, which returns a div element containing a list of images. Each image is wrapped in a div element with a class name of slider.
The map function is used to iterate over the imageList array and create a div element for each image. The count state variable is used to determine whether the current image should be displayed or hidden.

5.The div element for each image contains an img tag with the source URL of the current image and two div elements with icons for navigating to the previous and next images.
The onClick event handler for the previous and next icons calls the handleClickMinus and handleClickPlus functions, respectively.
Finally, the component is exported as the default export.

Overall, this code creates a simple image slider component that allows users to navigate through a list of images using previous and next buttons.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
